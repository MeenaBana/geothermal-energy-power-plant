## Problem Statement
The problem was described by giving the answers to the following questions;
How to design a geothermal binary cycle power plant? Identify the associated technological risks? Does it
require energy storage or not? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a geothermal power plant?

## Project description
The project was mainly focused on answering the problem statement as well as modeling *Organic Rankine Cycle* (ORC), harvesting geothermal energy by using different methods and approaches, analyzing and visualizing geothermal energy in the world (with the help of literature), and utilization of geothermal resources in Europe. 


<a id="modeling-analysis"></a>
## Modeling and Analysis
An ideal Organic Rankine Binary Cycle was modeled in MATLAB. Different kinds of geothermal energy data such as the utilization of geothermal energy, resources, comparison with the other energy technologies, etc. were analyzed and visualized. This was done with the help of literature however most of the data was taken from the publically available data at the [**IRENA**](https://www.irena.org/Statistics) (Internation Renewable Energy Agency) website.

## Conclusions
Based on the study and results a suitable conclusion was made that was basically explained the least concerning points and suggested the areas where work and improvement are required.

## Further Work
In further work possibilities, geothermal production and re-injection wells could be analyzed. Thermodynamic properties of wells could be defined and complex mathematical equations can be solved by using MATLAB or Simulink.
